Flow Chart







The project is planned to be completed in 3 sprints. Tasks assumed to be completed in the sprint are:
Creating the flow of the application
Initializing git repository to track changes as development progresses.
Writing the Java program to fulfill the requirements of the project.
Testing the Java program with different kinds of User input
Pushing code to GitHub.




Sprint 1 

As a developer, I want to build register/login functionality.
As a developer, I want to allow user to view flights as per preference.
As a developer, I want to allow admin to add/modify flight related information

Sprint 2 

As a developer, I want the user to be able to successfully view flight prices and names as per preference
As a developer, I want the user to be able to book a flight via a payment gateway
As a developer, I want the payment gateway to be authenticated properly to prevent any flaws in the transaction process

●Add all the files to your git repository using the following command:
git add .
●Commit the changes using the following command:
git commit .  -m  <commit message>
●Push the files to the folder you initially created using the following command:
git push -u origin master

Conclusions
In the program an application has been developed with a duration of three sprints. This application  handle the data of the FlyAway. All the data about airlines are visible to user. The admin can login through a User ID and password and manipulated the data.
